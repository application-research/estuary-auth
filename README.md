[![Go](https://github.com/application-research/estuary-auth/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/application-research/estuary-auth/actions/workflows/go.yml)

Estuary Auth Service is a service that provides authentication for Estuary. It's to decouple the authorization from Estuary core to allow any API developers to easily build authenticated APIs for Estuary.
